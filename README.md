**A Windy.com-inspired, dual-core analysis platform that fuses historical SAR data with real-time weather to provide on-demand, explainable insights into global flood risks and deforestation.**

This project is a submission for the **"Through the Radar Looking Glass: Revealing Earth Processes with SAR"** challenge. We didn't just build a tool; we created an immersive exploration experience. Our platform empowers any user‚Äîfrom a concerned citizen to a policy maker‚Äîto click anywhere on Earth and instantly receive a sophisticated, AI-driven analysis of environmental changes and risks, explained in clear, simple terms.

Our Approach to the Challenge

The "Through the Radar Looking Glass" challenge is not just about processing SAR data; it's a call to become a data detective. It asks us to solve riddles hidden within radar imagery, to hypothesize about the unseen forces shaping our planet, and to tell a compelling story with our findings. Our platform was architected from the ground up to answer these core questions.

#### **Challenge: "What can you hypothesize about the physical drivers behind what you see?"**

**Our Solution: An Explainable AI (XAI) Engine.** We moved beyond simple change detection. Our platform automatically fuses the **effect** (a flood detected by SAR) with its most likely **cause** (extreme precipitation from weather data). The result is an instant, evidence-based hypothesis generated for any location, such as: *"The flood risk is High because this area is historically vulnerable (proven by SAR) AND a significant rainfall event is forecasted (the physical driver)."*

#### **Challenge: "Can you tell the trees and the water apart? Can you detect how the forest is changing over time?"**

**Our Solution: A "Zero-Input" Dual-Core Analysis Engine.** We recognized that a user shouldn't need to be an expert to detect change.
*   **For Water:** Our multi-criteria flood algorithm intelligently distinguishes new floodwater from permanent water bodies using the JRC Global Surface Water dataset.
*   **For Forests:** Our "Deforestation" mode requires **no date input**. It smartly compares the most recent three months against the same period from the previous year, using both SAR (for structural change) and optical NDVI (for vegetation health) to robustly detect and quantify changes over time.

#### **Challenge: "How will you present your findings? Don't forget to focus on compelling storytelling..."**

**Our Solution: An Immersive, Interactive Data-Storytelling Platform.** We rejected static reports. Inspired by Windy.com, our platform turns every analysis into an interactive story.
*   **The Map is the Narrative:** Results are not just numbers in a box; they are living layers on a dynamic map.
*   **Context is King:** The user can instantly switch between our unique SAR analysis, live weather radar, and various forecast layers, exploring the full context of the story from every angle.
*   **The Story Unfolds On-Demand:** Every click on the map generates a new, unique story for that specific location, empowering users to become explorers of their own environment.

## ‚ú® Core Features

Our platform is built on three foundational pillars: **On-Demand Analysis**, **Intelligent Fusion**, and **Immersive Experience**.

#### üõ∞Ô∏è Dual-Core Analysis Engine
Seamlessly switch between two powerful, on-demand analysis modes with a single click:

*   **üåä Flood Risk Assessment:**
    *   **Retrospective Analysis:** Utilizes 90 days of historical Sentinel-1 SAR data to calculate a quantitative **"Historical Vulnerability Index"** for the selected area.
    *   **Predictive Insight:** Fuses this vulnerability index with a 7-day weather forecast to generate a forward-looking, actionable risk level (Low, Medium, High).

*   **üå≤ Deforestation "Then vs. Now" Watch:**
    *   **Zero-Input Intelligence:** Users no longer need to know *when* deforestation occurred. Our backend **intelligently compares** the last 3 months of satellite data against a historical baseline from the previous year to automatically detect recent deforestation.
    *   **Multi-Source Validation:** The algorithm confirms deforestation by detecting a drop in **both** SAR backscatter (indicating a change in surface roughness) and optical NDVI (indicating a loss of vegetation health), significantly reducing false positives.

#### üß† Explainable AI (XAI) Engine
We don't just show data; we tell its story. Every analysis is accompanied by a clear, evidence-based report that explains *why* a conclusion was reached, detailing the SAR, optical, and meteorological drivers.

#### üé® Immersive UI/UX inspired by Windy.com
*   **Map as Interface:** A full-screen, dark-themed map is the heart of the application.
*   **Dynamic Data Layers:** A professional, always-visible right-side panel allows users to instantly toggle between multiple global data layers:
    *   **Live Weather Radar** (from RainViewer)
    *   **Forecast Layers** (Wind, Precipitation, Temp from OWM)
    *   **Our Unique SAR Analysis Results** (Flood or Deforestation)
*   **Interactive Controls:** Floating panels, an interactive forecast timeline, and seamless transitions create a fluid and engaging user experience.
*   **Live Global Data:** The map is populated with live temperature labels for major cities, making the world feel alive and data-rich from the moment you arrive.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Architecture

Our system is designed with a modern, decoupled architecture for scalability and robustness.


*(A simplified architecture diagram illustrating the data flow.)*

*   **Frontend (`dashboard_windy_final.html`):**
    *   **Core:** Built with pure **HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)** for maximum performance and zero dependencies.
    *   **Mapping:** **Leaflet.js** for a lightweight, powerful interactive map.
    *   **Real-time Layers:** Dynamically integrates tile layers from **OpenWeatherMap** (forecasts) and **RainViewer** (live radar).

*   **Backend (`main_professional.py`):**
    *   **Framework:** A high-performance asynchronous API built with **Python 3.10** and **FastAPI**.
    *   **Geospatial Engine:** All heavy-duty satellite data processing is delegated to the **Google Earth Engine (GEE) Python API**, leveraging Google's planetary-scale computational power.
    *   **Asynchronous Tasks:** Analysis requests are handled as background tasks to ensure the API remains responsive.
    *   **API Endpoints:**
        *   `POST /api/v9/analyze`: The single, intelligent endpoint that receives a location and analysis type, and orchestrates the entire backend workflow.
        *   `GET /api/v9/tasks/{task_id}`: Allows the frontend to poll for the status and results of an analysis task.

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
*   Git
*   Python 3.10+
*   A Google Earth Engine enabled account

### Setup & Execution
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash

## üåü Future Vision (Level 3)

While our current platform is a fully functional prototype, we have a clear vision for its evolution into a true AI-powered predictive engine:

1.  **Phase 1 - Automated Data Curation:** Develop a pipeline to systematically analyze decades of historical SAR and weather data, creating a massive, labeled dataset of weather events and their corresponding flood/deforestation outcomes.
2.  **Phase 2 - Predictive Model Training:** Train an **Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)** on this dataset. This model will learn the complex, non-linear relationships and be able to *predict* the probability and scale of a flood based purely on weather *forecast* data.
3.  **Phase 3 - AI Explainability with SHAP:** Integrate the **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** library to make our AI model's predictions transparent. This will allow us to precisely quantify which forecast parameter (e.g., precipitation sum, wind speed) contributed most to a specific risk assessment, providing unparalleled, trustworthy insights for decision-makers.
